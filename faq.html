            This section is known as the <b>Frequently Asked Questions</b> tab. Here, you will find the answer to most of your questions. If you do not see your question below, feel free to send me a message and I will do what I can to help. <b>If you ask a question that is <u>already answered below</u></b> I will not respond! I respond within 24 hours as I spend (a lot) of time on IMVU. If you spam me, you will be flagged and blocked. If you send any hate mail, you will be flagged and blocked. I do not respond to hate mail and I do not respond to spam either. <b>DO NOT ADVERTISE.</b> I'm sorry, maybe I'm cold for saying this, but frankly, I don't care about your shops or whatever muse you have going on.</br></br>
