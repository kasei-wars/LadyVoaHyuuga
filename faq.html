            This section is known as the <b>Frequently Asked Questions</b> tab. Here, you will find the answer to most of your questions. If you do not see your question below, feel free to send me a message and I will do what I can to help. <b>If you ask a question that is <u>already answered below</u></b> I will not respond! I respond within 24 hours as I spend (a lot) of time on IMVU. If you spam me, you will be flagged and blocked. If you send any hate mail, you will be flagged and blocked. I do not respond to hate mail and I do not respond to spam either. <b>DO NOT ADVERTISE.</b> I'm sorry, maybe I'm cold for saying this, but frankly, I don't care about your shops or whatever muse you have going on.</br></br>
    </br>
<b>Will you gift me?</b></br>
No.</br></br>
<b>May I add you?</b></br>
I don't accept random adds. I only add people who I've chatted with frequently. I have a tendency to clean out my friends list a lot as well, because to me, friendship is family and so if someone goes for so long without talking to me, I simply remove them as a friend.</br></br>
<b>Do you develop on IMVU?</b></br>
Yes. I create my own derivables and I create my own textures.</br></br>
<b>Do you take requests?</b></br>
No. Not at the moment.</br></br>
<b>Who made your homepage?</b></br>
I did. I coded and I designed it all.</br></br>
<b>What programs do you use?</b></br>
I use Blender to 3D develop, Paint Tool Sai for drawing and occasionally textures, and I use GIMP to create my layouts/homepages. I use Visual Studio Code for coding.</br></br>
<b>Will you teach me how to code/draw/develop?</b></br>
I am a lot of things, however, a teacher is not one of them. So, no. <b>I will not teach anyone.</b></br></br>
<b>Do you have badges?</b></br>
Yes, i do. I have a Naruto sage badge, a Hinata, Kushina, Minato, and Jiraiya badge that can be purchased for 5,000 credits. I might consider trading my badge, however that's only if I like the badge being offered to me. I'm quite picky, but you may ask.</br></br>
I have <b>two other badges</b> my Naruto and Hinata badge and my Kurama badge. These two badges are <b>not available to anyone.</b> I will not trade or sell them. My Kurama badge is for friends only and my NaruHina badge is strictly for my love and I.
