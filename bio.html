    <h4>Voadicia</h4>
            Hello. I'm Voadicia, you may call me <b>Voa</b> or <b>Hinata</b>. Whichever you like. Voadicia is not my real name, only those who are close to me know my real name. I am 22 years old, I reside in America, and I am a third-year college student. My major is <i>Graphic Design</i>. I like to design, draw, and code. Currently, I am learning how to 3D design. I am an artsy person, yes I am. I have many hobbies, but the previous three I listed are what I consume my time with.</br></br>
    I like to stay busy because I have a cluttered mind. Staying busy helps me to not get lost in my thoughts because that happens to me easily. I can be easy to talk to but I can also be hard to talk to. It really depends on you. I was raised old-fashioned, to always have manners and to respect everybody equally. If I do not feel I have received the same respect back, then I will most likely act cold towards you. I am a very caring person, I try to help whenever I can. I am also very empathetic, I can sympathize with many. I don't like to compare my hardships with others, so if someone comes to me about their problems I might bring up an experience I have had, though it is not to compare but to relate. However, I try to refrain from sharing personal experiences and just try to lend advice or a listening ear.</br></br>
I try not to be judgemental, but as a human of nature, it is only natural for me to react differently when shown something that I am not familiar with. Though, I can at least say I always interpret new experiences with an open-mind. I have my beliefs and my ways, one of my biggest rules that I live by is acceptance. I accept that the world will change and people may not agree with who I am all the time, but <b>I will always stay true to myself.</b></br></br>
I don't like manipulative personalities, I don't like liars, I don't like bullies, and I don't like anatangonists much. Though I may have some favorite characters from fictional shows who are anatangonists, I recongize reality and I don't like real life anatangonists. I do not like meddlers, as I am a private person and I believe that should be respected. If someone tries to meddle too much with me, they will discover quickly that I shut down and refrain from talking.</br></br>
I don't like conflicts because I am a very emotional person. I wear my heart on my sleeve, so conflicts for me are very difficult to process. In conflicts, I find myself becoming overwhelmed with all the emotions that I feel and I blow up, resulting in a bigger problem. So, to avoid conflicts, I will try to talk with the person first and if they seem hostile, I will walk away. Though it could be viewed as me giving up, I see it as <b>you cannot force everyone to change or listen to you.</b></br></br>
As you can tell, I have a lot to say. Only if you ask the right questions, though. I am a cautious person who is always observant and always on alert, I read between the lines and it's easy for me to see beneath the surface. I guess a lot will view me as high-strung, and that is true. But, I do have a goofy and laid back side.

            I can feel it,</br>
        Can you feel it?</blockquote>
