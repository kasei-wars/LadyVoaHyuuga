          <b>Welcome to my page.</b> If you have any questions for me, please <u>read</u> <a href="https://kasei-wars.github.io/LadyVoaHyuuga/faq.html">FAQ</a> tab <i>before</i> messaging me. If you have messaged me and I don't respond, it is most likely because you asked a question that's <b>already been answered in the FAQ tab.</b> Otherwise, I am online frequently so I typically respond to messages within 24 hours.</br>
      With that being said, feel free to look around my page or don't! Too-da-loo!
